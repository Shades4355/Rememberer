# README


### Overview:

This is my front end to a project that was ultimately scrapped by the project lead. I plan to work on it in my free-time to make a Minimum Viable Product.

The point of this app is to be a repo for memory based apps. The left column would display the names of the apps, and said names would be links to the apps themselves. The right column is the Newsfeed, which is used to keep users up to date about any changes to Rememberer or it's linked apps.
